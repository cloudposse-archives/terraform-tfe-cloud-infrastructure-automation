# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to provision workspaces & configurations in Terraform Cloud via YAML configuration.

  NOTE: Requires [Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing).

# Introduction to the project
#introduction: |-
#  This is an introduction.

# How to use this module. Should be an easy example to copy and paste.
usage: |-
  Here's how to invoke this example module in your projects:

  ```hcl
  provider "tfe" {
    version  = ">= 0.21.0"
  }

  module "example" {
    source = "https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-tfe-cloud-infrastructure-automation.git?ref=master"

    # Directory containing all YAML configurations
    config_file_path = "config"
    organization     = var.organization

    vcs_repo = {
      branch             = "main"
      ingress_submodules = true
      # We recommend exporting the `FOOBAR` environment variable instead of passing a variable
      oauth_token_id     = var.oauth_token_id
    }
  }
  ```

# Example usage
examples: |-
  Here is an example of using this module:
  - [`examples/complete`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-tfe-cloud-infrastructure-automation/) - complete example of using this module

  We use YAML for the configuration files in order to separate configuration settings from business logic. It's also a portable format that can be used across multiple tools. Our convention is to name files by `$env-$stage.yaml` (e.g. `ue2-testing.yaml`), so for example an `$env` could be `ue2` (for `us-east-2`) and the `$stage` might be `testing`. Workspace names are derived from the `$env-$stage-$project`, which looks like  `ue2-testing-eks`.
  
  ```yaml
  # Projects are all the top-level root modules
  projects:
    # Globals are exported as TF_VAR_... environment variables in every workspace
    globals:
      # Used to determine the name of the workspace (e.g. the 'testing' in 'ue2-testing')
      stage: testing
      # Used to determine the name of the workspace (e.g. the 'ue2' in 'ue2-testing')
      environment: ue2

    # The configuration file format is designed to be used across multiple tools.
    # All terraform projects should be listed under this section.
    terraform:
      # List one or more Terraform projects here
      first-project:
        # Controls whether or not this workspace should be created
        # NOTE: If set to 'false', you cannot reference this workspace via `triggers` in another workspace!
        workspace_enabled: true
        # Override the version of Terraform for this workspace (defaults to the latest in Terraform Cloud/Enterprise)
        terraform_version: 0.13.4
        # Controls the `auto_apply` setting within this workspace
        auto_apply: true
        # Optional filename trigger to match (default is *.tf)
        filename_trigger: "*.*"
        # Add extra 'Run Triggers' to this workspace, beyond the parent workspace, which is created by default
        # These triggers mean this project workspace will be automatically planned if any of these workspaces are applied.
        triggers:
          - uw2-testing-example2
          - gbl-root-example1
        # Set the Terraform input variable values for this project. Complex types like maps and lists are supported.
        vars:
          my_input_var: "Hello world! This is a value that needs to be passed to my `first-project` Terraform project."
      # Every project should be uniquely named and correspond to a folder in the `projects/` directory
      second-project:
        workspace_enabled: true
        # Specify a custom project folder (defalts to the project name if not specified)
        custom_project_folder: my-custom-project-folder
        vars:
          my_input_var: "Hello world! This is another example!"
